        <p>Yutaka Ozaki (尾崎 豊, Ozaki Yutaka, November 29, 1965 - April 25, 1992) was a Japanese musician. He is ranked at No. 23 in a list of Japan's top 100 musicians by HMV.</p>

            <h2 class="substitle">Biography</h2>
            <p>He was born in Tokyo Setagaya Ward SDF Central Hospital to Kinue and Kenichi Ozaki. He had one older brother, Yasushi. Early in life, he was hospitalized with intestinal torsion and bronchitis which subsequently weakened his internal organs. In 1973 he began studying martial arts and continued training throughout his life. In January 1975 he began playing piano and in March of that year, he wrote his first poem. His first live performance was in 1978 at his school's cultural festival. He was discovered by producer Akira Sudo and signed to CBS Sony in 1983.</p>
            <p>Yutaka Ozaki debuted in December 1983 while he was still attending high school with his hit single "Jūgo no Yoru" (15の夜, "A night at Fifteen") and his album Seventeen's Map (十七歳の地図, Jū-nana-sai no Chizu, literal translation: "The Map of a Seventeen Year Old"). He gained tremendous support from his younger fanbase with his devastating live performances along with his unique lyrics that expressed dreams and love or the meaning of life. He represented the angst of adolescence, and a lot of the times attacked what he felt was unfair in society or schools.</p>
            <p>On April 25, 1992, Ozaki was found naked, drunk and unconscious in a Tokyo alleyway. He was taken by ambulance but was soon dismissed from the hospital. He died several hours later. The cause of death was reported as pulmonary edema but many theories have arisen as to the actual cause of death, the most popular being homicide. He was survived by his wife, Shigemi, and his son, Hiroya Ozaki.</p>
